Task-01: Implement Caesar Cipher This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm for both encryption and decryption. Users can input any text message along with a shift value to see the transformed output. This project is a part of the PRODIGY Cyber Security Internship tasks.

## üîê Task-01: Implement Caesar Cipher

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions.

---

## üß† What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in a message by a set number of positions down the alphabet.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` script.
2. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Input your message.
4. Enter a shift value.
